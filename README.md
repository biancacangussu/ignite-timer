# Ignite Timer

**Ignite Timer** is a task timer application built with React, TypeScript, and others modern libraries. It allows you to efficiently manage tasks, integrating `react-hook-form` for form handling, `react-router-dom` for navigation, and `styled-components` for styling. The app also utilizes `zod` for data validation and `date-fns` for date manipulation. The project is set up with Vite for fast development and build processes, and ESLint is used to ensure code quality.

## Key Technologies:
- React & TypeScript
- `react-hook-form` for form management
- `styled-components` for CSS-in-JS
- `date-fns` for date manipulation
